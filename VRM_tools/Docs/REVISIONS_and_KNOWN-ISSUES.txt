===================
  REVISIONS: (Jan 2022)
===================

 (1) Ability to change the REFINEMENT map resolution: (Gen_REFMAP.ncl)
  ====================================================
    * The editor has a default resoultion (720,360) which gives 
      a good balance between responsiveness and grid editing for 
      less powerful compute/graphics environments. For some grids, 
      this resolution is not adequate and a higher resoultion makes 
      the process easier. 
      When the VRM_Edior reads in a refinement map via the actions
      menu, the program adapts to the resolution of the map. This 
      provides a means for changing from (720,360) to an alternate 
      resolution. 
      The NCL program Gen_REFMAP.ncl was added to make is easyier for 
      users to change the resoution:
  
      (1) Edit the NCL script to set the desired resolution and set 
          the name of the default REFMAP file to be created. 
      (2) Run the script. It generates a REFMAP with values all set to 0.
      (3) In VRM_Editor, Read in the new Refinememt Map via the actions 
          menu. 
      (4) Edit the higher resolution map just as for the default resolution.
    
      
 (2) Ability to save the Refinement Grid for manual editing
  ==========================================================
    * When SquadGen is run, it creates a text file containing the refinement levels 
      for each cube face. This file can be edited to tailor the grid refinements 
      to the users needs and to fix blemishes in the grid. 
      Once edited, the revised file is passed back as an argument to SQuadGen to 
      create the EXODUS file. The VRM_Editor/Create_VRMgrid programs did not 
      provide this functinality. 

      The Create_VRMgrid program, is equivalent to the SQuadGen but it is compatable 
      with the VRM_Editoer program. Unlide SquadGen, it uses netCDF refinement maps 
      instead of a PNG image and the grid rotations occur before refinement rather 
      than after refinement. 

      To add the ability for users to manually edit grid cube values using 
      VRM_Editor/Create_VRMgrid, an ability to write the text files was added 
      to VRM_Editor and to read the text files was added to Create_VRMgrid. 

      Once a grid has been generated, A new option in the Action menu allows the
      user to save the text file containing the refinement levels on the 
      base-resolution cube grid. The user can then edit the file as desired and pass
      it as an argument (along with the exact settings from the VRM_Editor) to 
      Create_VRMgrid to generate the final EXODUS file. 
     

 (3) Additional FILL options for Polygon Editor
  ==========================================================
    * The Polygon editor now has 3 fill options:
        "Fill All"     - The entire selected region is filled with the 
                         given Value. 
        "Fill MaxVal"  - Within the selected region The values are 
                         set to the Maximum of the given value and the 
                         current value in the refinement map. 
        "Fill MinVal"  - Within the selected region The values are 
                         set to the Minimum of the given value and the 
                         current value in the refinement map. 

      With these options, the user can make fine adjustments to the 
      refinement map to remove blemishes in the grid and to clean up 
      transition regions so they a uniform around the refinement region. 


 (4) Additional FILL options for Rectangle Editor
  ==========================================================
    * To be consistent with the Polygon editor, the same FILL 
      options were added for the Rectangle editor. 





===================
  KNOWN ISSUES: 
===================

 (1)  VRM_Editor crashes ~randomly~
  ===================================
    * The pattern of failure is consistent with a memory leak 
      problem. SQuagGen was not originally developed for interactive 
      use, so it may not be releasing memory cleanly.
      But: the origin of the problem is unknown. 

    Update: Found that the user interface was too sensitive and, depending 
            on the cursor input, generated a surious event to change the 
            Grid_Type to Icosahedral just as the Generate_VarMesh button 
            is clicked. Since that Grid_Type is not fully functional in 
            SQuadGen, this caused a failure.
    
            The interface was made less sensitive and the VRM_Editor is
            less prone to crashing. 

     * STILL FAILS: Though the program is more stable, the fix did not 
                    eliminate the failures completely. The SPRING smoothing
                    code fails for certain (rare) combinations of grid rotations 
                    smoothing options. 
             As the code processes grid line segements, each segment should have 
             only two faces associated with it. At failure, it ends up with a 
             segement with more than 2 faces associated with it. 


  (2) Polar Grids are Cumbersome to edit
  =======================================
    * The Cylindrical view makes editing a bit cumbersome. Adding alternalte
      views (e.g. polar) for editing would be helpful.

  
  (3) Rotations Before and After Refinement
  =========================================
    * The grid rotations in VRM_Editor are done BEFORE refinement while the 
      rotations in SQuadGen are done AFTER refinement. Being able to rotate
      the grid after the refinement in VRM_Editor may be useful for some 
      applications.
